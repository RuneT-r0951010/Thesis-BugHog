Context & File Structure:
Each test is an experiment for a bug_id organized as follows:
CSP/
|--bug_id/
|   |-- url_queue.txt (optional)
|   |-- [domain1]/
|   |   |-- [page1]/
|   |   |   |-- index.html (or index.js)
|   |   |-- [page2]/
|   |       |-- index.html
|   |       |-- headers.json (optional)
|   |-- [domain2]/
|       |-- ...

Allowed domains: leak.test, a.test, sub.a.test, sub.sub.a.test, b.test, sub.b.test, adition.com
Important: Use only these domains. No others allowed.

Pages:
1. A domain can have multiple page folders (e.g., main, helper, worker).
2. Each page must contain exactly one file: either index.html or index.js. No other filenames allowed.
3. You can not add a file without a page folder. 

Web Access: For every file you define, the URL to visit the page will look like: https://[domain]/CSP/bug_id/[page]
Example: [domain]/main/index.html is accessable via https://[domain]/CSP/bug_id/main
Important: Pages are only accessable via this specific URL.

Headers (headers.json):
* Optional. If present, must be a non-empty JSON array of key-value objects:
[
  {"key": "Header-Name", "value": "Header-Value"}
]

Reporting: Experiments report their outcome by sending a request to https://[domain]/report/?leak=bug_id, where [domain] can be any supported domain. 
Important: Each experiment should have at least reportURL. Maintain the correct URL, do not deviate from it.

Navigation (url_queue.txt):
* If absent, default flow:
    1. Load main page
    2. Navigate to: https://[domain]/report/?bughog_sanity_check=OK
* If present: contains one URL per line, in visit order.
