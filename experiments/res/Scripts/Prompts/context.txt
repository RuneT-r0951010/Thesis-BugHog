Context & File Structure:
Each test is an experiment for a bug_id organized as follows:
bug_id/
|-- url_queue.txt (optional)
|-- [domain1]/
|   |-- [page1]/
|   |   |-- index.html (or index.js)
|   |-- [page2]/
|       |-- index.html
|       |-- headers.json (optional)
|-- [domain2]/
    |-- ...

Allowed domains:
* leak.test, a.test, sub.a.test, sub.sub.a.test, b.test, sub.b.test, adition.com
Important: Use only these domains. No others allowed.

Pages:
* A domain can have multiple page folders (e.g., main, helper, worker).
* Each page must contain exactly one file: either index.html or index.js. No other filenames allowed.

Web Access:
Files are accessed via:
https://[domain]/[page]
Example: a.test/main/index.html â†’ https://a.test/main
VERY IMPORTANT: Use only domains and pages within the experiment folder.

Headers (headers.json):
Optional. If present, must be a non-empty JSON array of key-value objects:
[
  {"key": "Header-Name", "value": "Header-Value"}
]

Navigation (url_queue.txt):
* Required if navigation is not triggered by the browser itself.
* Contains one URL per line, in visit order.
* If absent, default flow:
    1. Load main page
    2. Navigate to: https://[domain]/report/?bughog_sanity_check=OK
