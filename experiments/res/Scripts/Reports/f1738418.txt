A given Content-Security-Policy: sandbox ...; HTTP header directive is not correctly enforced for <embed> and <object> child frames during load, allowing to bypass the set restrictions.
Test case
parent.html:
Content-Security-Policy: sandbox

<iframe src="child.html"></iframe>
<embed src="child.html"></embed>
<object data="child.html"></object>
child.html:
<script>prompt(document.domain)</script>
Expected result
Per the blanket sandbox directive, all three child frames should be treated as cross-origin loads and be denied script execution.
Actual result
The <embed> and <object> children are able to execute same-origin script code.
CSP3 spec reference:
6.2.2. sandbox
The sandbox directive specifies an HTML sandbox policy which the user agent will apply to a resource, just as though it had been included in an iframe with a sandbox property.
I will follow up with additional details to the root cause.
