This was reported to me out of band by Mario Heiderich (in CC):

If a HTTP response contains two CSP headers, the second one wins.
The spec however, mandates that they are combined to a stricter intersection (see URL field).

Example policies
1) content-security-policy: default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
2) content-security-policy: default-src 'self'

Here's what I observe:
* two CSP headers (1, then 2): 2 wins.
* two CSP headers (2, then 1): 1 wins. XSS possible.

This is especially interesting with header injections.
(The behavior is the same if the header injection attempts to resume the previous header. This is possible with injecting the newline and a space character and then overwriting a directive, i.e. injecting: "\n default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
