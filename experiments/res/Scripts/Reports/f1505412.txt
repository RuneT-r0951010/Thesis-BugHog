Steps to reproduce:

* Opened console
* Ticked preserve log
* Visited https://arturjanc.com/cgi-bin/ff63-nonce-redirect.py


Actual results:

An exception gets logged and reported:
Content Security Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at https://payments.google.com/payments/v4/js/integrator.js (“script-src”).

This is due to the fact that the script is dynamically loaded and redirects to "https://www.gstatic.com/..."

This looks like a special case of bug 1469150 which was marked as fixed. Apparently it is still there for dynamically loaded scripts.

This is not just a security issue for fingerprinting, but also a functional bug as it would break applications that use nonces correctly.


Expected results:

No violation reported.
