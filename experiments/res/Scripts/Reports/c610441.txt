DETAILS
Missing spec on Upgrade Insecure Requests(Navigational Upgrades)
Step to reproduce:
Go to page which is enabled "Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests"
When a user clicks a http link, chrome will not treat a http link as "https" link.
Expected result:
When a user clicks a http link, chrome will change a http url to https url.
W3C specification has an example....
Navigational Upgrades
Megacorp, Inc. isn't quite ready to deliver Strict Transport Security headers [RFC6797], but does want to keep users on secure pages when possible. Happily, this comes for free with upgrade-insecure-requests. That is, they're already delivering pages with the following header:
Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests
This allows user agents to treat the following HTML code:
<a href="http://example.com/">Home</a>
as though it had been delivered as:
<a href="https://example.com/">Home</a>

Authors should be able to ensure that all internal links correctly send users to the site's secure address, and not to its pre-migration insecure address.
