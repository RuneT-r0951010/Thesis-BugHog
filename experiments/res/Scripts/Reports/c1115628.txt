VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Chrome does not properly inherit a CSP through blob URIs even though they share the same origin as the context thats creates them.
As long as an attacker can execute JavaScript on a victim page, this allows CSP to be entirely bypassed by creating a blob URI and assigning it to the top frame's location.
Note that this vulnerability is not present in Firefox because it treats blob URIs similarly to about:blank. As far as I can tell, the spec is unclear about this: https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#originOfBlobURL.
VERSION
Chrome Version: 84.0.4147.105 stable
Operating System: Windows 10 OS Version 1903 (Build 18362.959)
This vulnerability is also present in Chrome canary 86.0.4231.0.
REPRODUCTION CASE
There are two origins involved in this PoC.
attacker origin: https://cgpq29r51wfnl2zd-attacker.okay.blue
victim origin: https://cgpq29r51wfnl2zd-victim.netlify.app
All paths on the victim origin have a CSP of: default-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'
There is also a secret value located at https://cgpq29r51wfnl2zd-victim.netlify.app/secret. Because of CSP, the victim origin is normally not able to fetch() the secret.
Therefore, if you visit https://cgpq29r51wfnl2zd-victim.netlify.app/blocked an error should appear in the console.
However, if you visit the attacker page at https://cgpq29r51wfnl2zd-attacker.okay.blue, the secret value should appear in an alert().
Analysis:
* The attacker page first loads the victim page in an iframe.
* The victim page then uses URL.createObjectURL to create a blob URI containing HTML which fetches /secret.
* The victim page then assigns the blob URI to parent.location. This replaces the parent attacker page, allowing the contents of the blob URI to execute without any CSP restrictions.
* Note that sandbox="allow-top-navigation" is used on the attacker page so the victim page can set the top frame's location without any user interaction.
* The contents of /secret are then displayed in an alert(). They could also easily be sent to the attacker's server.
The attacker page, the victim page, the secret page, and the blocked page are attached.
