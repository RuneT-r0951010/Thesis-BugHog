Hello

If the javascript is loaded as a result of some redirect it can contain the sensitive data and the final url can be known in the current domain context.

1. If the loaded script do some action, what restricted by CSP (create images for e.g.) I see the post-redirect URL with sensitive data in the CSP report (the source-file field)
2. If I call some function from loaded script and it causes an error - I see the post-redirect URL in the stacktrace of the catched error.

This bug can be used for steal sensitive data from uri in some OAuth-like flows or for steal some other sensitive data from url after redirects.

The example of page and screenshots in the attach.
