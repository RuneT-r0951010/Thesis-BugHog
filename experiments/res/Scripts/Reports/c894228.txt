Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to https://vuln.shhnjk.com/iframer.php?url=https://test.shhnjk.com/blobCSP.html
2. Observe an alert

What is the expected behavior?
alert is blocked by CSP

What went wrong?
Patch of issues 799747 tries to see if there is any parent/opener where blob URL can inherit CSP from. Since they finds parent with no CSP, blob URL will happily inherit that and bypasses CSP.

Did this work before? N/A
