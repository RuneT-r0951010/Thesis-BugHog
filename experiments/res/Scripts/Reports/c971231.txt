Steps to reproduce the problem:
Same as the issue I submitted earlier:

https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=671271

I submitted this issue in 2016 , and In 62.0.3197.0, you landed the fix.
but in 75.0.3770.80 this security issue can be reproduced again.

how to reproduce:

Edit an html file like this

```
<html>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'self';img-src 'self'"/>
<body>
<button onclick="breakit1()">CSP TEST1</button>
<button onclick="breakit2()">CSP TEST2</button>
<script>
    function breakit1(){
        open("javascript:'<img src=https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png>'","_self");
    }

    function breakit2(){

        location.href="javascript:'<img src=https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png>'";
    }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Click the button and you will find that the image was successfully loaded.
Content-Security-Policy img-src directive is set to 'self'.

What is the expected behavior?
Content security Policy block this image

What went wrong?
remote image is loaded

Did this work before? N/A
