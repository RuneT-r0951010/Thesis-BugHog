VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Chrome's CSP does not block favicon request properly.
Due to this, attacker can bypass CSP partially and get sensitive information via favicon request.
FYI, Spartan has same bug. Firefox is OK. But Firefox Mobile has same bug. I will report to both vendor later.
VERSION

windows 8.1
REPRODUCTION CASE
Go to http://vulnerabledoma.in/csp_favicon . This page has CSP header and only following contents:
<link rel=icon href=http://www.google.com/favicon.ico?0123456789>
See console. You can see the following message:
Refused to load the image 'http://www.google.com/favicon.ico?9.17194871771247' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'none'". Note that 'img-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
But in fact, Chrome sends favicon request. See the request using network tool.
FYI, Chrome Mobile(Android) has same issue. Also, the following request does not block by CSP:
<link rel=apple-touch-icon href=http://www.google.com/favicon.ico> <link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed href=http://www.google.com/favicon.ico>
