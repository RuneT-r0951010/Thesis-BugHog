VULNERABILITY DETAILS
It is possible to bypass the CSP of a page by creating and opening a blob URL in a new tab that will redirect itself to another page and back using a meta redirect and history.back (similar to a page reload).
The blob URL inherits the CSP of the page that opened it, but after a page reload the CSP ends up being discarded, leading to a bypass of the directives that were previously set by the opener - which I believe shouldn't be happening.
