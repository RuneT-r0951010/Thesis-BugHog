Steps to reproduce:

Open the following PoC.
http://mallory.csrf.jp/x-mixed-replace/csp/bad.php



Actual results:

The response from above URL is multipart/x-mixed-replace and it contains two text/html documents in it. Both documents triggers alert(1); and alert(2) from the inline-script. This URL is protected by CSP with default-src 'self' so the inline-script should be ignored but Firefox doesn't.


Expected results:

CSP should be applied to all documents in a multipart/x-mixed-replace response.
The inline script script execution should be ignored like ordinal HTML document (see following URL).
