VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Given a CSP header of script-src \*.a.localhost, the script <script src="//a.localhost/script.js"></script> should not be loaded. CSP spec section 4.2.2 step 4.6 states "If the first character of the source expressionâ€™s host-part is an U+002A ASTERISK character (*) and the remaining characters, including the leading U+002E FULL STOP character (.), are not a case insensitive match for the rightmost characters of url-host, then return does not match". Scripts such as <script src="//b.a.localhost/script.js"></script> should be allowed by this policy.
