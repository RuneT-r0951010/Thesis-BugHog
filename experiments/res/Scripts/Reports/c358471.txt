Steps to reproduce the problem:
Set script-src 'self' on iframe that loads a worker; the worker will make cross-origin request that should be blocked.

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
With CSP "connect-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'" the
XHR to b.lvh.me fails, but the importScripts request does not.

Did this work before? N/A
