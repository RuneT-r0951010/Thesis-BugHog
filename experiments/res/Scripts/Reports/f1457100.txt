Step to reproduce:

1. Navigate the following data URL (or create a HTML document with the same content and navigate it):
data:text/html,<meta http-equiv="Content-security-policy" content="script-src none;"/><script>alert(location)</script><object data="data:text/html,object<script>alert('object')</script>"></object><iframe src="data:text/html,iframe<script>alert('frame')</script>"></iframe>

Expected result: no JavaScript gets executed (no alert is shown)
Actual result: one alert saying "object" is shown

This demonstrates that the iframe's document inherits parent's CSP, but the object's document doesn't. According to https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/#which-policy-applies they should behave the same way, i.e. being governed by "the policy of the embedding resource".

This can be also used to bypass WebExtensions relying on CSP to block scripts: even though the embedded document has null origin, it could deliver a self-contained exploit.
