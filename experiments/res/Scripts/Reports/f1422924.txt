Steps to reproduce:

Load a page serving an SVG with an accessKey event (see attached SVG) and the CSP header script-src 'none'. 


Actual results:

When the button is pressed, the accessKey event fires. 


Expected results:

The accessKey event should not fire. SVG access key events are blocked by Firefox when javascript is turned off via `javascript.enabled` in about:config due to the possibility of using them as a scriptless keylogger. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=704482 for the original bug report leading to this mitigation and a PoC keylogger. 

As Firefox currently works, a developer could be serving a page with Javascript disabled via CSP as a security measure, and an attacker would be able to inject a scriptless keylogger into the page.
