VULNERABILITY DETAILS
I suspect following change caused this bug.
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/2ce31ab03b0e860eefff56647617e9851937eb12
Before above change, navigation inside iframe to about:blank, data:, javascript:, and about:srcdoc would commit navigation into existing process, so those url would inherited the origin/process of navigation initiator.
But after the change, if <iframe src="//evil.com"> on victim.com tries to navigate to about:srcdoc, then this will inherit the origin of parent (i.e. victim.com) which is weird.
I was able to abuse this fact to bypass CSP. This is because CSP will try to inherit CSP from navigation initiator.
