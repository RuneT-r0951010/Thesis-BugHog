Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to https://test.shhnjk.com/csp_open.php
2. Click go

What is the expected behavior?
CSP violation report sent to test.shhnjk.com (CSP implementor)

What went wrong?
If <base> tag is specified to cross-origin (via local-scheme docuemnt or HTML injection) and CSP report-uri is relative URL, CSP violation report can be sent to cross-origin.

This could be used to steal cross-origin information in violation report since report might contain secret information like nonce, referrer, page URL, and so on.

Did this work before? N/A

I'm wondering this might further affect other report-uri features such as HPKP, XSS auditor, Expect-CT, and so on. Which I will test later today(I hope).
