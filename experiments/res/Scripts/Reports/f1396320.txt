Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to https://test.shhnjk.com/allow-scripts.php?xss=%3Csvg%20onload=alert(document.domain)%3E
2. You will see alert with document.domain


Actual results:

alert with document.domain


Expected results:

Firefox should grant opaque origin to document when CSP sandbox doesn't have allow-same-origin flag. Currently, "Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts" is enough to execute script with origin.

"The sandbox directive allows any resource, framed or not, to ask for the same sorts of restrictions to be applied to itself."
