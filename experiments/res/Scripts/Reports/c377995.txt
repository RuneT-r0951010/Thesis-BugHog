VULNERABILITY DETAILS
We can bypass the header('Content-Security-Policy:sandbox') and access the DOM of sandboxed URLs.
What we are doing is very simple: inject code into the page *before* it has been loaded, so Chrome will honor that code even when it should discard it. In other words, Chrome should behave exactly as if the sandboxed URL were coming from a different domain, deleting injected code. Once it reads the header, boom, destroy injected code so it doesn't run.

REPRODUCTION CASE
Attached is the PoC, but here's the explanation because it's quite simple:
We open a new window which is header-sandboxed.
w = window.open("sandboxed.php","","width=400,height=400");
Before it loads, we inject an event and code:
w.onload = new w.Function("alert(document.body.innerText);document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>HACKED BY THE MAIN WINDOW</h1>'");
That's it! Chrome will not delete the event/function so it will run in the sandboxed window.
Thanks!
