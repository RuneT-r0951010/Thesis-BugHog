VULNERABILITY DETAILS
Please provide a brief explanation of the security issue.
By loading a new document using window.open("","_blank") and document.write-ing into it, (being in about:blank) I can circumvent the CSP restrictions put on the document my js code was running on and reach out to other sites.
One could argue that the code was loaded with unsafe-inline in the CSP header, but that should still block any cross-site communication (e.g. 1x1px tracking image etc).
The about:blank page has the same origin as its loading document, but CSP restrictions have been removed.
I have seen there have been many issues around about:blank, but I have not found any reports just like this.
My tests show that Firefox does not show this behavior, but rather makes the new document inherit CSP from its loading document.
