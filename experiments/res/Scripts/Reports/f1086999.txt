There is a discrepancy in our CSP implementation and the spec. The spec says [1] that blob:, data:, and filesystem: should be excluded in case of a wildcard (allow all) when matching source expressions.

Currently we allow all schemes in case of an asterisk wildcard, e.g. here: [2].

We should update our implementation to follow the spec.
