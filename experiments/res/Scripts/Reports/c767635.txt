Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Go to https://test.shhnjk.com/simple.html
2. data URL navigated by cross-origin inherited parent's CSP

What is the expected behavior?
CSP does not inherit to cross-origin navigated data URL.

What went wrong?
Chrome always inherits CSP to data URL, whether it was navigated by same-origin page or cross-origin page. Thus allowing cross-origin page to gain information of CSP by navigating data URL which contains check of various CSP directives (PoC checks img-src and style-src).

PoC shows that image request was block by parent's CSP but stylesheet was allowed. This data can be used to determine parent's website (by CSP fingerprint) and/or weakness of parent's CSP.

Did this work before? N/A

Why Chrome started blocking server side redirect to data URL even inside iframe (see second iframe)?
