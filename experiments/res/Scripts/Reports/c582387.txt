Steps to reproduce the problem:
Popups opened in the following way execute the contained script (which then have access to the DOM of the opener) even if the page was loaded with a CSP that forbids inline-scripts (works fine in FF):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
  par = 'val';
  url1 = "javascript:'<scr" + "ipt>alert(`dom: `+document.domain+`\\\nPdom:`+parent.document.domain+`\\\npar: `+opener.par);</scr" + "ipt>'";
  open(url1);
  url2 = "javascript:alert(`dom: `+document.domain+`\\\nPdom:`+parent.document.domain+`\\\npar: `+opener.par);";
  open(url2);
</script>
</head>
</html>

What is the expected behavior?
Script execution in Popup is blocked due to CSP

What went wrong?
CSP is inherited to popup opened with "javascript:"-URL

Did this work before? No
