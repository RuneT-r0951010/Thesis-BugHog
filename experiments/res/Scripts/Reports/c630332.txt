Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. Issue a CSP that includes form-action 'self'
2. Add a form to a page that POSTs elsewhere with target="_blank"
3. Submit the form

What is the expected behavior?
The form should be blocked.

What went wrong?
I would have expected the form to be blocked but it is not.

Did this work before? N/A

Firefox blocks both forms, Chrome only blocks the one without a target attribute.
